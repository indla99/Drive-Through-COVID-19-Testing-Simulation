# Drive-Through COVID-19 Testing Simulation

## Introduction
This repository contains a simulation tool for drive-through mass testing for COVID-19, aimed at improving planning and operational efficiency. It utilizes an agent-based simulation approach, allowing individuals to drive up to a testing facility for testing without leaving their vehicle, thus reducing transmission risk and increasing efficiency.

## Problem Statement
The tool addresses the need for efficient COVID-19 mass testing, using drive-through facilities to minimize virus transmission while optimizing testing processes.

## Motivations
The project highlights the efficiency and effectiveness of drive-through testing in pandemic management, proposing simulation as a key tool for optimizing facility design and operation.

## Research Objectives
- Develop an agent-based simulation model for a drive-through COVID-19 testing system.
- Optimize the system's design and operation using simulation.
- Investigate the impact of various policies and interventions on system effectiveness.

## Model Design
Combines agent-based and discrete method simulations, focusing on interactions between testing staff, registration staff, and passengers.

## Data Collection and Experiment
Allows user control over simulation parameters like service lane capacity, registration/testing time, and incoming car rate.

## Results
Illustrates outcomes like average wait times, number of people tested, and car throughput under different configurations.

## Conclusion
Emphasizes the role of detailed planning and simulation in enhancing the efficiency of mass testing facilities during pandemics.
